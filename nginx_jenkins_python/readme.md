## Problem
This repository contains a small Python web application that shows the uptime of the current system.
 -Login using the provided IP address, user and password in the instruction email
 -Bring up Jenkins on the instance
 -Deploy the provided web application to the instance
 -Use nginx (or the tool of your choice) so that we can reach Jenkins from the web with the IP address and the path "/jenkins" and the web app at "/uptime"
 -Make sure that these come up automatically on startup!
 -Bonus: Create a Jenkins pipeline to run the unit test on git push to the repository (note: you will need to host this repository yourself)
 -Bonus: Dockerize the web app, what problem do you run into?

## setup nginx

## setup jenkins

## configure jenkins behind nginx

## configure python app behind nginx
